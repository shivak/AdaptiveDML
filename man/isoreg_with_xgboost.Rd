\title{Isotonic Regression with XGBoost}
\usage{
isoreg_with_xgboost(
  x,
  y,
  max_depth = 15,
  min_child_weight = 20,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or matrix of predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A vector of response variables.}

\item{max_depth}{Integer. Maximum depth of the trees in XGBoost (default is 15).}

\item{min_child_weight}{Numeric. Minimum sum of instance weights (Hessian) needed in a child node (default is 20).}

\item{weights}{A vector of weights to apply to each instance during training (default is NULL, meaning equal weights).}
}
\value{
A function that takes a new predictor variable \code{x} and returns the model's predicted values.
}
\description{
Fits an isotonic regression model using XGBoost with monotonic constraints.
}
\details{
This function uses XGBoost to fit a monotonic increasing model to the data, enforcing isotonic regression
through the use of monotonic constraints. The model is trained with one boosting round to achieve a fit
that is interpretable as an isotonic regression.

# Example data
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 1)
y <- sort(rnorm(100))

# Fit the model
iso_model <- isoreg_with_xgboost(x, y)

# Predict on new data
x_new <- matrix(rnorm(10), ncol = 1)
predictions <- iso_model(x_new)
